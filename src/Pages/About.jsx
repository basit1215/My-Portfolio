// "I'm Abdul Basit, and I recently completed my intermediate degree from Jinnah Govt. College. I have also finished my frontend development journey at SMIT, where I learned to build modern web applications using Next.js, React, and JavaScript, along with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, Iâ€™m studying React Native to expand my skills into mobile app development. I'm actively looking for an internship to further enhance my skills. After completing React Native, I plan to dive into backend development to become a full-stack developer."
